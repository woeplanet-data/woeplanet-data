Woeplanet is a gazetteer of places. Not _all_ the places in the world but a lot of them.

What's a gazetteer? It's a list of places, each with a stable, unique identifier and some descriptive metadata about that place.

## Who's On First?

Any similarity between Woeplanet and [Who's On First](https://www.whosonfirst.org/) is entirely coincidental. Inspiration for Who's On First came from Geoplanet, Yahoo's (now defunct) global gazetter and inspiration for Woeplanet came from Who's On First, especially on repository naming conventions and GeoJSON properties.

## The Short Version

So `woeplanet` is WhereOnEarth (AKA WOE) (AKA Geoplanet) data, based on Yahoo's GeoPlanet Data download, with some, but not all, of the original hierarchy linkages reinstated, with some, but not all, centroid and polygon coordinates added in from other data sources and formatted as GeoJSON, one file per WOEID and organised by Geoplanet place type.

Someday someone, maybe me, will write up a history of Geoplanet, but for now this will have to suffice.
